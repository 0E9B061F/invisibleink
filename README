Invisible Ink a small tool to simplify working with gpg-encrypted text. The
default command, 'edit', will decrypt or create a given file and edit the
cleatext (if any) using your editor of choice. When you exit your editor, the
modified cleartext will be re-encrypted.

Example: ii /secret/master-plan edit
         ii /secret/master-plan

The 'echo' command can also be given, in which case the decrypted cleartext
will be written to STDOUT. Useful for piping the cleartext to another program.

Example: ii /secret/master-plan echo | less
