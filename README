ii (invisible ink) is a small tool to simplify working with gpg-encrypted text.
By default, ii will decrypt the given file, open the cleartext for editing
(with $EDITOR), and then re-encrypt the file when your editor exits. A normal
invocation looks like this:

  ii /secret/master-plan

/secret/master-plan will be edited using the value of $EDITOR.

ii can also be given a command in addition to a file. The given command will be
executed with the cleartext file as it's first argument. For example,

  ii /black/magic less

will display the cleartext contents of /black/magic using 'less'.
