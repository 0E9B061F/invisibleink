> Backup existing encrypted file before overwriting with modified file?
  The backup would be removed if all goes well, or left behind if there is some
  error.

> Better/different handling of temporary files in the case that re-encryption
  fails.
  Currently, any changes made to the cleartext will be lost if re-encryption
  fails. The user should be notified, however, that the plaintext has been left
  sitting around.

> Perhaps the user should be able to specify a default recipient key, and/or
  specify one on the command line (overriding the default).
